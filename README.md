# NodeJS Plugin

The NodeJS plugin for Rainmeter allows you to harness the full power of Node.js directly within your skins. It acts as a bridge, enabling you to execute JavaScript files, run asynchronous operations, and interact with the Rainmeter API from a Node.js environment. This opens up a world of possibilities, from fetching data from complex APIs to performing heavy computations without freezing your desktop.
